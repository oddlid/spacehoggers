Spacehoggers

A rewrite of spacehoggers.pl in pure Go, as the Perl script has been quite useful, but installing extra Perl modules is annoying.
A static binary is good for this utility.

This utility will not take into account filesystem block size, like 'du' does, but will only report on the actual sizes of files.
